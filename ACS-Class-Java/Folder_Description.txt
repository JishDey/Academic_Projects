This is the archive for the work that I did in my Advanced Computer Science class in 10th grade. All projects are written in java and are mostly from the Java Methods book by Maria Litvin.

No files in the textbook folder were written by me. Not all files in the Projects folder were written by me, Jishnu Dey.

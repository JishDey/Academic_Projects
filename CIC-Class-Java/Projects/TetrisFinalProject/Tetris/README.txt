Tetris project
Jishnu Dey

These folders are a mess, here is a guide if you are curious about my first few attempts. Otherwise RunningVer2 is the final version.
features:
    move pieces down by one - RunningVer
    collision -  rotate down left right (if can action, action) - RunningVer
    score - RunningVer2
    rotation - Blocks
    manual piece movement instantaneous - RunningVer2
		this is the feature that makes movement more responsive in RunningVer2 than in RunningVer
    space to send - RunningVer2
	T-spins(without checking for it) - RunningVer2
	Game over screen - RunningVer2

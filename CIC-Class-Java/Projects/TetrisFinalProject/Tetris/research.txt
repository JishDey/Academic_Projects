Tetris has:
	seven tetronimoes - T, L, S, Z, I, J, O
	Simple rules:
		pieces can rotate in either direction (the up arrow key can choose a direction)
		there is a grid where all pieces are at all times
		pieces fall at a constant rate and lock when they hit another piece(filled square) 
		when a row is complete it disappears
			this means tetronimoes might have parts of them dissappear
		when a column is complete it's game over
		stop a piece from rotating where it can't
	Complex rules:
		a piece may be able to rotate into place
		scoring multiple lines in a row gives you more points
		the more you play the faster the game goes
		n-bag - create a 'bag' of n pieces to randomize the order of pieces without repeating things multiple times
		points: one point for every time a piece goes down, many points for line clears and tspins
